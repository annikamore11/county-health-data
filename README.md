-   Download files from `data/` separately if no updates are needed.
-   When reading in `2025-county-health-filtered`, make sure to delete the apostrophe in `fips` values (apostrophe was needed to keep `fips` as a character field).

## Required Packages 

-   `dplyr`
-   `tidyr`
-   `readxl`
-   `readr`

## Update Schedule

-   County Health Rankings program releases annual data each spring, typically in March.
-   Data is delivered via bulk CSV files <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/methodology-and-sources/data-documentation>
-   Data is updated, but each measure may be updated to different years. See documentation.

## Important Considerations

-   New data releases are not always in the same format and may contain variable names that have changed. When updating the data make sure to reformat and clean data for current release.
-   `US` geography level was formed by averaging or summing data from all the states. It was not a provided geography from County Health Rankings.
